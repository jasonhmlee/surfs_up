# Surfs Up
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of the project was to help W. Avy analyze temperature trends before opening the surf shop. I was able to analyze the percipitaiton for the month of June and December to determine whether or not the business is sustainable year-round

## Results
### From our analysis, we were able to figure out the percipitation for the month of June and December. We could see that in the month of June, we had a total of 1700 whereas in December we had 1517. The mean for June was 75 and the mean for December was 71. The min value was 64 for June and 56 for December. The max values was 85 for June and 83 for December

### From the analysis, we can conclude that there was more rain in June compared to December. June had the higher count, higher min, and also the higer max percipitation. One query we can use to analyze more deeply is to see if there is a increase or decrease of rain in the recent years. We can group by the month and year to see the trend. Another query we can use is to count the number of days where there was no rain at all.
